# Lab2 - Install Hadoop and run Map Reduce


### Task 1 - Install Hadoop

I use Ubuntu and found few good links to set it up on my system. Mac and Windows users need to set up accordingly. This could be a challenging part as there might be a lot of errors popping up. Rectify with patience and you will certainly enjoy the outcome!

### Task 2 - Write Mapper.py and Reducer.py to perform word count in python 

Concept of Map Reduce - Refer prof Di's slides. I beleive the concept is well explained with an example.

### Task 3 - Run Mapper.py and Reducer.py on Hadoop
Using Hadoop Streaming - https://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/

If you're using the Hadoop streaming interface, the  tutorial will show you how to run the program. A sample Python version of the WordCount program is provided in files Mapper.py and Reducer.py. All you need to do is to run them and see the results. The text file is available in the same repo.

Your submission should include 
1) A screenshot of the successful installation of Hadoop (Name nodes and data nodes running)
2) mapper.py and reducer.py scripts.
3) The result of the word count of the text file. You should be uploading the output file or should be taking a screenshot of the results like the one in the repo. Name it like lab2-results.png. In the screenshot you can see the file 'part-00000' which is the output file. You should be able to generate the same.
